# Task List with Angular and Angular Material

Followed the tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8&t=1287s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia)
but used Angular Material instead and wrote a few things slightly differently.

It also uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) which you can run with the npm script provided that
is also called **json-server**. It will start the server on port 5000 using the **db.json** file.

It is basically a very simple task list app where you can add and remove tasks. A task has a text, time and a reminder
which will highlight it in the list.
